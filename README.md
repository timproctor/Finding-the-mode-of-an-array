Finding-the-mode-of-an-array
============================

You don't love Ruby if Hash.new(0) combined with a_tally(number) += 1 doesn't blow your mind.

The input for this method is any array of numbers, like: [2,3,6,3,9,7,3,1,2,5,7,2].

The output is an array of the number(s) repeated most, called mode.  Come on! Ruby's 

syntactic sugar is pretty darn cool.
